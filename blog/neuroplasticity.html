      <h3 class="blog-h3">1. How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people ?</h3>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity refers to our brain’s ability to change and adapt in response to our behaviour. Simply put, new neuron connections and pathways are created in our brain when we 
        develop a new habit or study something new.<br><br>
        
        From science perspective, the more we train and exercise our brain, the more neural connections are established. Understanding our brain’s malleability allows us to develop strategies 
        and positive habits when it comes to learning new skills. For example, neuroplasticity promotes your ability to learn a new language or learn how to play a musical instrument. By 
        practicing and repeating an activity over and over, we stimulate our brain to develop a greater neural network, which in turn supports our learning progress.

      <h3 class="blog-h3">2. How will I engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my benefit ?</h3>
      <p>
        To increase your neuroplastic change, you can opt to set up a new challenging activity, for instance, learning 20 new words of your language of interest per week and try to commit 
        yourself to that exercise as frequently as possible.Other methods such as playing memory games or constant practice of meditation also helps improve your neuroplasticity.

      <h3 class="blog-h3">3. What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity ?</h3>
      <p>
        Presentation skill is probably the area I would like to work on and I believe Dev Academy will offer me a great environment to strengthen that skill.

      <h2 class="inline-hyperlink">Growth Mindset</h2><br>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3 class="blog-h3">1. What is growth mindset and why is it relevant ?</h3>
      <p> 
        Growth mindset refers to how a person view challenges and setbacks. People with growth mindset often see failure as an opportunity for them to work on their weaknesses and further 
        strengthen their abilities instead of hiding away from others and thinking of themselves as someone who is incapable of achieving success. Former president of the United States, 
        Barack Obama, once said <strong><em>“some of the most successful people in the world are the ones who had the most failure”</em></strong>. And those people who had to climb over mountains of obstacles 
        and challenges are great examples for how having a growth mindset can influence your life positively.<br><br>

        While neuroplasticity suggests that your brain can change over time when being exposed to new habits and behaviours, growth mindset indicates that you can always change and grow. 
        More importantly, scientific studies have illustrated that growth mindset can encourage the development of new neural pathways.

      <h3 class="blog-h3">2. In this exploration, did anything surprise me ?</h3>
      <p>
        Though there wasn’t much of a surprise for me but reading in-depth information about neuroplasticity and growth mindset helps solidify my belief that I can one day become a developer 
        and motivates me to overcome difficult challenges in this bootcamp.

      <h3 class="blog-h3">3. How will I integrate growth mindset into my learning journey ?</h3>
      <p>I will start cultivating a growth mindset by embracing the followings:
        <ul>
          <li>See challenges as opportunities to learn and grow</li>
          <li>Reflect on each day about what I have learned, what mistakes I have made and how to rectify them</li>
          <li>Replacing <em>‘I cannnot’</em> and <em>‘I don’t know’</em> with <strong><em>‘I am not able to ... yet but I will’</em></strong></li>
        </ul>
