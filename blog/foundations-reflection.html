        <h3 class="blog-h3">1. What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning ?</h3>
        <p>
          - Though I can be quite committed to something once I have set a goal, my level of commitment during the foundation was at a much higher standard. I think my passion for coding made 
          that possible.<br>
          - I was able obtain some self-taught programming knowledge through researching and exploring online resources. I used to think that I could only code with someone showing me what to 
          do step by step.<br>
          - I picked up new coding techniques and skills relatively fast compared to what I thought I could

        <h3 class="blog-h3">2. What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming ?</h3>
        <p>
          Values and self-awareness are crucial elements in helping me unleash my full potential during my learning and programming journey. With empathy, I can fully understand people I 
          interact with and that will enable me to develop strong connections with them.

        <h3 class="blog-h3">3. What has surprised you the most about the core learning ?</h3>
        <p>
          The biggest surprise that core learning brought to me was the opportunity to reflect and better understand my values and my identity as well as be aware of how my strengths drive me 
          through difficult times.

      <div>
        <h3 class="blog-h3">4. What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning ?</h3>
        <p>
          The most challenging part was writing about how my culture influenced my identity. I have talked to people about how my origin and surrounding environment shaped the person I am today.
          But to concisely merge all those detail into a blog, I found it quite difficult.

        <h3 class="blog-h3">5. Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course ?</h3>
        <p>
          Dev Academy is aware that intelligent people can study well and even accomplish great academic achievements but people who are successful not only as a professional but also as a 
          person are those who have emotional intelligence, growth mindset and a deep understanding of their values.<br> 
          Dev Academy wants to see each individual graduating from this bootcamp to succeed in their career as well as to contribute to a better community.

      <div>
        <h3 class="blog-h3">6. Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?</h3>
        <p>
          I would never say it’s a waste of time doing those core learning. Those soft skills are vital at work and are equally important in daily life. Having a great wealth of technical 
          insights without the soft skills might hinder one’s career advancement. <br>
          One common thing across high-profile people running big tech companies like Google or Apple is that they all have great soft skills. Through communication and comprehensive 
          understanding of their audience and customer, they have created unrivalled products that can benefit many people all over the world.
